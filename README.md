# Frontend of the Picky Home Assignment

I decided to use create-react-app to create the UI of this app because I'm more familiar with React than Next.js.

# Create:
1. "Add Image" button and preview box.


# Though process
* Use a simple input of type "file" to open the native file selector. 
* After selecting the file, a preview of the image should render. I should use a state to hold a reference to the selected image. 
* I should validate to make sure the file selected is a valid image.
